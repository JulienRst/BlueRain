# BlueRain.js

## Installation

copy ./src/blueRain.js and ./src/main.scss in your libs / modules / helpers folders

don't forget to adapt the scss files, you probably only need the .container part

## Getting Started

```JavaScript
  import blueRain from './path/to/blueRain'
  import './path/to/blueRain'
```

```JavaScript
  blueRain(htmlElement, optWidth = 20, optHeight = 40, marge = 3)
```

- htmlElement is the container in where the BlueRain will appear
- optWidth and optHeight are the wanted dimensions of the tiles
- marge is the distance you'll put in your scss for the tiles


That's all :+1:
